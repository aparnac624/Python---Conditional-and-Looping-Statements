# Python---Conditional-and-Looping-Statements

This repository contains solutions for a series of basic Python exercises. Each exercise demonstrates various programming concepts, including conditionals, loops, and mathematical operations.

## Exercises

1. **MonthNames.py**  
   A program that reads an integer value between 1 and 12 from the user and prints the corresponding month name.

2. **CinemaTicket.py**  
   A program to calculate ticket price based on age: full price for adults, half price for those under 16, and one-third price for seniors 60+.

3. **BodyMassIndex.py**  
   A program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height, and provide the corresponding weight status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese).

4. **GreatestNumber.py**  
   A program to find the greatest of three numbers provided by the user.

5. **Factorial.py**  
   A program to find the factorial of a number using loops.

6. **ReverseNumber.py**  
   A program to reverse a number using a `while` loop.

7. **MultiplesOfNumber.py**  
   A program to find and print the multiples of a number up to a specified limit.

8. **BreakLoop.py**  
   A program that takes user input and prints the input, continuing until the user types 'done'.

9. **FizzBuzz.py**  
   A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

10. **Pattern.py**  
   A program that prints a number pattern in a descending order.

## Note : Have attached the output of each program at the end of program as output.
